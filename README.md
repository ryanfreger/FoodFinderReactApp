This is a Food Finder App. As a user, you type in what kind of food you want to eat (i.e pizza) and your location (i.e san francisco or zip codes also work) and through Yelp and another site called Edamam, Food Finder will return restaurants in your area matching what you want to eat, as well as recipes with more info if you want to cook yourself.

For restaurants, it will show the user an image, their average price of meals in dollar signs, their rating, as well as other info, such as their location on a map (Google Maps API), whether or not they are currently open, their phone number, address, and links to their website and Yelp page.

For recipes, it will show the user an image of the meal, the total calories, how many servings the recipe will yield, total protein, carbs and fats in the meal, as well as other info, such as a list of ingredients.

The user can toggle between the Restaurants and Recipes by using the Eat Out and Dine In tabs.

Technologies used: React, Redux, Axios, Enzyme, Jest, among others.
